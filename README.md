# ðŸ§  VegaHed

> A full-stack knowledge archival tool inspired by Vegapunkâ€™s Punk Records in One Piece.

## ðŸ“‹ Project Overview

VegaHed is a full-stack web application inspired by the One Piece character Vegapunk, who consumed a Devil Fruit that allows him to remember everything he has ever read. However, the more knowledge he learns, the larger his head grows. To solve this, he invented **Punk Records** - a server that stores his knowledge and links to his brain, allowing him to keep learning without worrying about the physical limits of his head.

**VegaHed** functions as a personal "Punk Record". Users can paste links to content such as YouTube videos, TikTok videos, Facebook posts, and other online materials. The system then automatically categorises the content, enabling easy review without the need to search through multiple platforms.
